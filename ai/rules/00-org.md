# Organization Engineering Rules

## Commits and pull requests

Use Conventional Commits. PR titles must be semantic.

Examples:

- `feat(api): add reading lookup endpoint`
- `fix(worker): handle Cloudflare timeout`
- `docs(readme): clarify local setup`
- `chore(ci): update release workflow`

## Before editing

Inspect existing patterns before adding new abstractions.

## Before finishing

Run the checks listed in `.repo-policy.yml`.

## CI/CD safety

Do not relax linting, typechecking, tests, coverage, or deployment protections to make a change pass.
Do not modify release or deploy workflows unless the task explicitly requires it.

## Secrets

Never commit secrets, tokens, credentials, private keys, `.env` files, or generated production configuration.

## Repository governance

Repositories should include:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

Never modify license terms unless the user explicitly asks for a license change.
Do not add an open-source license to a private/proprietary repository unless explicitly instructed.
When adding a license file, match the license type to the repository visibility: MIT or similar for public/open-source repos, proprietary/all-rights-reserved for private repos.
Check `.repo-policy.yml` for the `visibility` and `license` fields to determine the correct license.
