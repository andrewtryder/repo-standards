# Python Rules

Use the existing dependency workflow unless the task explicitly migrates package management.

Preferred checks:

- `ruff format --check .`
- `ruff check .`
- `pytest`
- `coverage run -m pytest && coverage report`

Use Ruff for formatting/linting and pytest for tests when configured.
